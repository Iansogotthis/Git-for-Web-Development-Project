Stretch Questions

     is an element with a positional value that is fixed . taken out of the "flow".
     other elements are positioned as if the absolute element wasnt there. 
      
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    flex

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    
    header/paragraph/section
    a, img
    width

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, 
    how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    its a model of webpage design that considers construction from the perspective of a packaged item
    ITEM IN BOX  = content
    BUBBLE WRAP: css mostly/buttons text boxes/interactivity and more
    BOX: html mostly/ the structure of the content, where and how the boxes 4 seperate walls become a
    "box" together where and how the sides meet and therefore how much viable space exists within it
    TABLE: the foundation supporting the site. 
    The land a house needs to sit on
     the surface outside on which the box is supported: white space: total viewport, presumably
    where the programming may get subjected to any limitations that may exist resulting from conflict between 
    the needs of website's  coding; the.coms requests and requirements and either 
    compatability with backend needs or the capabilities of the browser itself
